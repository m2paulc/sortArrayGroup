/**
 * Challenge 6 in zero to mastery course
 * Question 1: Clean the room function.
 * Given an array [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], 
 * make a function that organizes these into individual array that is ordered.
 * For example: answer = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],4,5,10,[20,20],391,392,591]
 * Bonus: Make it so it organizes strings differently from number types 
 * i.e: [[1,1,1],2,3,['a','b','c']] 
 *
